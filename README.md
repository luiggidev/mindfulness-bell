## Description
Recurrent bell strikes to remain mindful/concentrated on the task at hand.

## Todo
- Add Recoil to manage states.
- Add other bells, working with advanced options.
- Disable tick function if bell is not activated? In theory the tick is used for intervals and if bell is disabled it should not run.
- Dont let user set 0 as value.
- Add Typescript support and refactor to be used with ReactJS.

### Maybe
- Add round progress bar:
